# Chatbot using NLP

## Overview
This project creates a chatbot utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The chatbot is capable of comprehending user intents and delivering appropriate replies based on established patterns and responses. It employs the `nltk` library for processing natural language, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, and `streamlit` for developing an interactive web interface. Additionally, it can perform basic arithmetic operations, allowing users to input mathematical expressions and receive calculated results.

## Features
- Understands various user intents such as greetings, farewells, gratitude, and more.
- Provides relevant responses based on user input.
- Performs arithmetic operations, enabling users to calculate expressions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Maintains a conversation history that can be viewed by the user.
- Built using Python and leverages popular libraries for NLP and machine learning.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download NLTK Data
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Usage
To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Type your message in the input box and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.

## Intents Data
The chatbot's behavior is defined by the `intents.json` file, which contains various tags, patterns, and responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or change existing ones.

---

## Conversation History
The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (`chat_log.csv`). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.
